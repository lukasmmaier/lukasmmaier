### About me...

I enjoy bringing new functionalities into all aspects of life (especially the automotive sector) by leveraging the power of Deep Learning methods. 

While I got into Artificial Intelligence at the end of my Bachelor's degree in Automotive Engineering at HS Esslingen, I'm currently enjoying learning more about Deep Learning and Computer Vision in the Master's programme in Electromobility at the Uni Stuttgart.

Key skills: Deep Learning and Computer Vision in <img align='center' src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-000000?style=flat&logo=python"> with <img align='center' src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Tensorflow-000000?style=flat&logo=tensorflow">.

    This thesis investigates whether monocular vision can be used for real-time 3D estimation of road profiles. Since the road profile significantly affects passenger comfort and vehicle dynamics, its estimation is crucial for active suspension systems allowing to improve both aspects. The developed concept combines a Visual Odometry approach (i.e. [DVSO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02570)) with a dense reconstruction method  (i.e. [MonoRec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11814)), followed by a post processing module. The evaluation showed that the upcoming road profile can be estimated using monocular vision.

  Two projects implemented during the Deep Learning Lab 22/23 of the Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory ([ISS](https://www.iss.uni-stuttgart.de/en/)) 
  1. Deep-learning based classification of retina image into cases of referable and non-referable diabetic retinopathy using CNNs. 
  2. Human activity recognition based on smartphone sensor data classified using RNNs.

    |Concept| Prognosis of therapy length [0,3] for (A) one patient and (B) a patient cohort (20 patients)|

    This paper reported a novel modeling methodology which aims to not only assist physicians in their decisions, but also inform about uncertenties of the given recommendation (i.e. therapy) in a comprehensive, user-centered way. This is enabled by combining structural explainable models, defined on Logic Neural Networks (LONNs) which replace conventional deep-learning methods with logical gates embedded in neural networks, and Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model data uncertainties. An evaluation based on a database for patients with heart insufficiency demonstrates the functionality of the methodology.
